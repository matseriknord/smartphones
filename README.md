### Intro
This is the source code, MD-files and README for the project in the Getting and Cleaning Data course in the Data Science specialization. The goal of the project is to practise the noble art of getting the raw data, cleaning it and build new data sets. Another part is to generate statistical information and save the processed data for further analysis.

### Project 
The project contains the following parts:

1. A data set which is downloaded and stored in **./UCI HAR Dataset/** folder.
2. An code book, **CodeBook.md** which describes the data sets, transformations and the operations.
3. This README.md file with general information and source details.
4. A R script **run_analysis.md** which does all the operations and transformations. This script downloads any files needed and creates a diretory structure.
5. A tidy data set is created an stored as a comma separated file. The name of the file is **tidyDataSet.txt**.
